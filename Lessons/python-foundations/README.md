## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

### Part 1: Python Data Types
 
- Discuss Python as a programming language.
- Define integers, strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries.
- Demonstrate arithmetic operations and string operations.
- Demonstrate variable assignment. 

### Part 2: Python Iteration, Control Flows, and Functions
 
- Define `Python` control flow and conditional programming.  
- Implement `for` and `while` loops to iterate through data structures.
- Apply `if, else` conditional statements.
- Create functions to perform repetitive actions.
- Demonstrate error handling using `try, except` statements.
- Use `Python` control flow and functions to help us parse, clean, edit and analyze data sets.

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:
- Recall and define common Python data types.

## Lesson Outline

> Note: Loops and functions may be challenging for newer practicioners. However they give us ALOT of power to manipulate data and create powerful models. I added some practice links to the class resources and I highly recommend finding additional time to become familiar with these concepts.

**Part 1 : Python Data Types** (90 min)
- Why Python? (5 min)
- Introduction to Data Types (10 min)
- Jupyter Notebook (5 min)
- Python Variables (5 min)
- Operators (10 min)
- Integers and Floats (5 min)
- Strings (10 min)
- Lists (10 min)
- Tuples (5 min)
- Dictionaries (10 min)
- Importing Packages and Documentation (5 min)
- Practice With a Partner (10 min)

**Part 2 : Python Iterations, Control Flow, and Functions** (80 min)
- If... Else Statements (10 min)
- Iterating With For Loops (30 min — consider mostly doing as a code-along)
- Functions (30 min — consider mostly doing as a code-along)
- While Loops (10 min)
- Practice control flow on Coffee Preference data set (if time remains, otherwise practice at home)
- Conclusion

## Class Challenge Exercises

> Some extra exercises to practice on!

### Starter Exercises

1.	Capture all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 7
2.	Capture all of the numbers from 1-1000 that have a 3 in them
3.	Provide the count of number of spaces in a string
4.	Remove any vowels in a string
5.	Capture all of the words in a string less than 4 letters

### Challenge Exercises
